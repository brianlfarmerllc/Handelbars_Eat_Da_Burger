  ## Description

  Eat Da Burger is a browser based application that utilizes handelbars and jquery to generate html front end, express server to provide server functionality, MYSQL as a database, with deployent through Heroku. 

  Eat Da Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to add to the resturant menu. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the burger is added the the burgers table in the mysql database and the app will display the burger in the burger menue on the left side of the page. 

  Each Burger in the menu has two buttons, an "Eat Burger"
  and a "Remove From Menu". Selecting the "Eat Burger" removes the burger from the menu and deletes it from the burgers table in mysql. Selecting the "Remove Fom Menu" removes the burger from the menu and moves the item to the Off Menu items on right side of the page with the option to add the burger back to the menu for special occasions.
